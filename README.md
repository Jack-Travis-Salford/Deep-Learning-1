# Deep-Learning-1
Salford University Year 3 - Deep Learning - Assignment 1.

This repo contains the neural networks used to complete the first Deep Learning assignment. This uses Python to utilze Tensorflow to achieve the set task. 

The task set was to create a basic neural network that will use the provided images to test, train and validate its success at identifying images of American Sign Language numbers. 

This network was then used as a baseline. Using our knowledge of how neural networks work, we then had to create a better one, changing things such as the amount of layers, the nodes of each layer, dropout layers, the optimizer and learning rate and using a pre-trained base, such as VGG16.

The writeup that accompanied this assignment is also available, which details the development process of the created network.
